**If the first link doesn't work, try the one below... and if that doesn't work please reach out to me. Sometimes when I load the program link I'm getting an "undefined" block where the predicate checking for spaces should be. The predicate in the last conditional should be " _ is identical to _" and didn't appear sometimes when I checked to make sure everything works. Idk why this happening but I know the program works as intended, thanks**
